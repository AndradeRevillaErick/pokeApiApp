# pokeApiApp

In this project, I utilized the Poke API to retrieve information about random pokemons and display them in a list. The application allows you to view the stats of each pokemon, remove an element from the list, or reset the entire list. To implement the functionality, I made use of different hooks and created custom hooks for handling the logic. For fetching the pokemon information, I utilized fetch and for the styling, I used glasmorphism.

If you want to see how the app looks, it is deployed on Vercel. You can access it using the following link:
